Welcome!

Project title: Landing Page was a project where I learned how to apply HTML and CSS concepts to organize content on the page.

Description: The purpose of the project was to learn how to create a menu and enable the landing page to take the user to the information after clicking an item from the menu. The landing page also contains a youtube video and submission email address box. The submission box was not intended to be functional. The platform called codepen was used to test the code and create a preview of the work.
